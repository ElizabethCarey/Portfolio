            <h3>DAW's Website (find it <a href = "https://elizabethcarey.github.io/DAW/">here</a>)</h3>
                <p>&bull; Designed the user interface of the website using Figma over the course of a month. Checked in with clients on a weekly basis to ensure</br>
                          they were satisfied with my designs.</p>
                <p>&bull; Developed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adapted designs from the Figma, changing prototyped aspects like animations</br>
                          as necessary.</p>

            <h3>UCLA Radio Archive (find it <a href = "https://www.figma.com/design/BVoheNYoV9yDjjFJejA3yF/Show-Archive-Revamp?node-id=0-1&t=6TdXSDHqgYZnwQ8t-1">here</a>)</h3>
                <p>&bull; Designed and prototyped the user interface for UCLA Radio’s show archive, a web project by UCLA Radio’s student
                          development team.</br></p>
                <p>&bull; Planned the site flow using FigJam, then used Figma to design various UI components with different states.</p>  
                <p>&bull; Presented a demonstration for UCLA Radio’s ~200 members at an all-station meeting. Detailed the design process  
                          to them, emphasizing aspects</br>
                          of the user interface that are intended to be intuitive and beneficial to the average user.</p>
    
            <h3>Bruin Community Care’s Portfolio (WIP)</h3>
                <p>&bull; Presented with the challenge of heightening the web presence of Bruin Community Care, a group of pre-Health students dedicated</br>
                          to providing mobile clinics to people in areas of the Inland Empire without guaranteed access to healthcare.</p>
                <p>&bull; Worked with the executives of BCC to develop a comprehensive visual portfolio for their organization, helping to raise awareness</br>
                          about their work for individuals who could be benefitted by it.</p>
