            <p>I am a 2nd year student at the University of California, Los Angeles earning a B.S in Cognitive Science (specializing</br>
            in computing) with an expected graduation date of Spring 2026. I have strong educational background in areas</br>
            such as human computer interaction, visual perception, and cognitive linguistics.</br></p>
            
            <p>As an aspiring UI/UX designer, I consider myself to be most passionate about crafting unique, user-friendly</br> 
            website and app interfaces. My university coursework has enabled me to think about designing user interfaces in</br>
            such a way that appeals to the psychology of the average person.</br></p>
            
            <p>However, my background as a visual artist has also made me inclined to explore more experimental mediums of</br>
            web design and development. I am currently involved with several projects that reflect this, and I am excited to</br>
            share them when they are ready!</br></p>
